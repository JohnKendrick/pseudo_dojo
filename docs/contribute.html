If you would like to contribute to the PseudoDojo project please visit the <a href="https://github.com/gmatteo/pseudo_dojo">githup repository</a>.
Fork the project and commit your contributions.
If you contribute new code, for instance for a new test, you also need to provide unittests for that code.
We cannot accept code additions without unittests.

Also contributing new pseudos should done via the git repository.
If possible try to perform the tests that are already present.
Some tests, like the Delta gauge, require all electron reference data, others don't.
