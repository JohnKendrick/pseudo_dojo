<h1>General</h1>

<h2>How do I cite the PseudoDojo?</h2>
The fully detailed paper on the pseudo dojo is still in preparation.<BR />
For the moment you can site:<BR />
<blockquote>
Reproducibility in density functional theory calculations of solids.<BR />
K. Lejaeghere et. all, Science  25 Mar 2016, Vol. 351, Issue 6280, <a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad3000'>10.1126/science.aad3000</a>
</blockquote>
When using ONCVPSP type pseudo potentials please cite:<BR />
<blockquote>
Optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials<BR />
D. R. Hamann, Phys. Rev. B 88, 085117 <a href='https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.085117'>10.1103/PhysRevB.88.085117</a>

<H1>Concerning the ONCVPSP pseudopotentials</H1>

<h2>Do you also have the pseudo for my favorite GGA or LDA functional?</h2>
We provide PBE, PBEsol and one LDA set of pseudo potentials.<BR />
The input files can be obtained from the dojo reports in the HTML files.<BR />
Using these you can generate potentials for most LDA and GGA functionals using <a href="http://www.mat-simresearch.com/">ONCVPSP</a>.<BR />
We could reuse most of out PBE inputs to generate the PBEsol potentials.<BR />
Using <a href="http://octopus-code.org/wiki/Libxc_functionals">LibXC</a>, which is linked to ONCVPSP, almost all functionals can be used.

<h2>All the ONCVPSP potentials are wiht non-linear core correction I need some without.</h2>
We usually observe better convergenc with so indeed all are generated with nlcc.<BR />
I yo really need one without take the input from the HTML page on the pseudo (select format : html and click the element).<BR />
Install <a href="http://www.mat-simresearch.com/">ONCVPSP</a>.
Turn icmod to 0 in the input and generate the pseudo.

<h2>What about hybrids and meta functionals?</h2>
These are currently under development.<BR />

<h2>Do you also have the other elements?</h2>
We are currently working working on the Lantanides.<BR />

<h2>Is it also possible to get the pseudos in other formats?</h2>
ONCVPSP currently supports psp8 and upf.<BR />
These are available for download.<BR />
We are looking at the possibility to also provide them in the psml format.<BR />

<h2>Will the fully relativistic versions of the potentials be available as well?</h2>
Yes, this is another project we are finishing at the moment.<BR />
Most of the current PBE inputs also generate well using the fully relativistic version of ONCVPSP.<BR />
When we have finished the final polishing we will also provide the last tuned special cases.<BR />
