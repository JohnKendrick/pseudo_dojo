<h1>Contributing to the PseudoDojo project.</h1>

<p>If you would like to contribute to the PseudoDojo project please visit the <a href="https://github.com/gmatteo/pseudo_dojo">github repository</a>.<BR />
Fork the project and commit your contributions.<BR />
If you contribute new code, for instance for a new test, you also need to provide unittests for that code.<BR />
We cannot accept code additions without unittests.</p>

<p>Also contributing new pseudos should done via the git repository.<BR />
If possible try to perform the tests that are already present.<BR />
Some tests, like the Delta gauge, require all electron reference data that are only available for specific functionals, others don't.
