Pd: Previous attempt to generate Pd without semicore lead to ghost state at +1 eV  

Ag: It seems difficult to get good logders without semicore

Cd:
    Cd.in:* Has ghost at +73 Ha $$ to discuss

In-d: GHOST_In-20eV (In-spd-high is much better for GW)

Sn-d: (ghost at +60, use Sn-spd-high for GW)

Sb-d: ghost at +20 eV, Use Sb-spd-high for GW

Te-d:** ghost at +77 eV  (Should try Te-spd-high for GW)

I: needs GW version

Xe:
    Xe.in: 

Cs-sp: logders are deviation from 2.5 H no ghosts to be seen however

Ba-sp-new: seems to have a ghost around 6 eV
    Ba-sp-new adds two projectors for f to improve deltafactor and GBRV tests. 

Hf: Needs a GW version fsp is probably unavoidable but log ders are not optimal.
    the p version is the only one that does not have an explicit f projector, did we never try?

Ta: the missing f, only at 1 H below the fermi level is probably too much to classify the sp as GW

W:
    W-sp.in
    W-fsp.in

Re: needs GW version

Os: needs GW version

Ir: removed the GW tag, 4f to close

Pt: fsp softer model core charge? the two highest energy points seem off...
    add an f projector to sp?
    $ removed the GW tag from sp, its high in energy and the fsp shows a serious overlap

Au: $ removed the GW tag from sp, its high in energy and the fsp shows a serious overlap
    $ we actually did the GW calcualtion on gold both SigmaX and SigmaC are seriously affected by unfreezing
    $ the 4f electrons ~10% total effect. since they are les deep in the Hf-Pt series I don't trust the GW tag on any
    $ of them on non f potentials

Hg: $ ghost in Hg clear example of what kind of signature in the logder produces a real ghost

Tl: $ -d has a ghost at ~ +60 eV similar signature as in Hg
    $ the 4f may still be to high in energy (4.2H) for GW

Pb-d: (ghost at +70, use Pb-spd-high for GW)
       $ the 4f may still be to high in energy (4.8H) for GW

Bi-d:* (ghost at +70 eV, use Bi-spd-high for GW)
    $ 4f at 5.6H

Po-d (ghost at +58 eV, use Po-spd-high for GW)
    $ 4f at 6.4H

Rn: d is only 1.7H below ef ...

Pt-sp: Regenerated with modcore 3
       (Pt-p gives much better deltafactor but has ghosts at +25 eV, 
        Pt-ex-sp does not improve, new df with pt-sp-icmod3 is 4.8)
        Ask michiel about MC

TODO: $ test for the 6th row the addition of an explicit f projector
TODO: Pd --> Cd (look at Pd/Ag/Cd carefully)
TO BE INVESTIGATED:
Cu-sp high
Test that there's no fr pseudo with local part taken from v(L)

W-sp, Re-sp (f channel could be improved)

In-d is very sensitive, changing XC (GGa-->LDA) gives a ghost very close to 0.
The first s projectors presents oscillations I don't see in the other pseudos.
