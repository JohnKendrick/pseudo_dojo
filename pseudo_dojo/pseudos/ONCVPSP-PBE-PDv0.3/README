H: is a ploc version
He: is the ploc version just as accurate as the standard but cheaper
O:** is dmax  (could smooth v(d))
F:***: could be improved (too hard)
Ne:* Hard to converge (brw: no model core charge) 
     Try: fcfact 1.0 rcfact 1.15-1.25

COULD BE IMPROVED
Na and Na/Na-sp-gw.in: (no model, chose one)
Mg.psp8 (ghost at +80 eV, it's the  fast version)
Mg/Mg-sp-gw.in  # no model could try: icmod fcfact 0 4 1.5

Al:** oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version
Si:** oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version
P:** requires GW version (bad mcore, dloc version --> no FR)
S:* requires GW version
Cl:** (vloc(d), slow convergence)
Ti-sp:* mc look ok but ask Michiel about mc params
V-sp:* mc maybe a bit too hard
Mn:****
Co:** ask michiel about mc in particular although I don't think we can improve it

Fe: the Fe potentials uses ncon 3 the standard is 4
Fe-sp:** model core charge too hard, try the one from Fe-sp-high.
Zn-sp:* I've added the GW tag (ok but not "perfect", ask Michiel if he has specialized version)
        Ask about mc params
Ge-d*: Reequire GW version (Ge-spd I've recently generated looks good but it's hard)
As:** No convergence (v(d)?)
As-d:* Require GW version (maybe As-spd?)
Se-d:* Require GW version (maybe Se-spd?)
Nb:* (large v(s))
Rh:** (high vs)
Pd.psp8: Previous attempt to generate Pd without semicore lead to ghost state at +1 eV  
         Ask michiel about Pd-sp and model core.
Ag.psp8: It seems it's difficult to get good logders without semicore
Cd-sp: Ask michiel about model core 
Cd.psp8 Has ghost at +73 Ha (should work on Pd/Ag/Cd)
In-d: GHOST_In-20eV
*******TEST PSEUDOS FROM PD TO XE (sp in valence?) *****************

Cs-sp:*** Should be regenerated (qcut optimization, improve logders)
Pb-d (high s, ghost at +70)
Bi-d (high p, ghost at +70)
Po (ghost at +58)



TO BE INVESTIGATED:
Pt-sp
Te-d 
Cu-sp high
Tc-sp (high v_s)
Sn (no GW)
Sn-d (no GW)
Sb-d (no GW, ghost) *
Te-d (ghosts is missing?)
Xe
Hg (no GW)
Rn*** (no minimum in EOS??)
W-p (ghost at 25 eV, interesting example)
Re-sp-new (f oscillates)
Pt-fsp with modcore 1 ***
Pt-sp with modcore 1
Try: Pt-sp and Pt-ex-sp
La/La-sp.in:# icmod fcfact 1 0.25
Test that there's no fr pseudo with local part taken from v(L)
