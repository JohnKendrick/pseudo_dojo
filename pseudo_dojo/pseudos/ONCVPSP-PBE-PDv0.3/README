H: 
    H.psp8 uses p as local part

He: 
    He.psp8 uses p as local part, just as accurate as the standard but cheaper

[Generated new pseudo, TO BE TESTED]
F:***   
    F.psp8 can be improved (model core charge too hard, phonons don't converge, ask michiel)

[Generated new pseudo, TO BE TESTED]
Ne*:
    Pseudos without nlcc.
    Ne.psp8: Hard to converge 

Na:
    Na/Na-sp-gw.in: (no model core charge)
    Na/Na-sp.psp8: (no model core charge)

Mg:
    Mg.psp8 has ghost at +80 eV, it's the fast low-accuracy version
    Mg-sp-gw.psp8 does not have model core charge.

Al: oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version

[Generated new pseudo, TO BE TESTED]
Si:** oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version
      Si-new seems better
      $$ lets use new

P: requires GW version (P-dloc replaced by P-new with 2 projectors for d
   slightly better df, can be used for FR version)
   $$ the model core charge should be improved
   $$ the algorithm detects dispersionless states but inspection of the BS does not show any


[new pseudo, TO BE TESTED Complete PHGAMMA]
Cl:** (vloc(d), slow convergence)
  $$ lets use new, some phonons are missing though

K:  $ hints may be a bit lower

Ca: $ hints may be reduced

Ti: $$$ add GW tag

Cr: $$$ tag for non-magnetic / magnetic
    $$ the mc for high is a bit questionable

Mn: $$$ tag for non-magnetic / magnetic

Fe: 
    the potentials uses ncon 3, the standard is 4
    Fe-sp:** model core charge too hard, try the one from Fe-sp-high.
    $$$ tag for non-magnetic / magnetic

Co: $ normal is good enough
    $$ mc seems a bit too much fitted

Zn-sp:* 
    I've added the GW tag (ok but not "perfect", ask Michiel if he has specialized version)
    Ask about mc params
    $$ Michiel will look at this. the total energy convergence look a bit suspicious...

Ge-d: Require GW version (Ge-spd I've recently generated looks good but it's hard)
    $ spd is good for GW

[DONE, RUNNING] phonons are missing
As:** No convergence (v(d)?) Try As-new with modcore from As
As-d:* Require GW version (As-spd has good logders but it's hard)

Se-d: Require GW version (Se-spd has good logders but it's hard)

Br : needs a GW version

Kr : needs a GW version

Nb: Replaced by Nb-sp-new (better convergence and df)

Rh: Replaced by Rh-sp-new (better convergence and df)

Pd.psp8: Previous attempt to generate Pd without semicore lead to ghost state at +1 eV  

Ag.psp8: It seems it's difficult to get good logders without semicore

Cd.psp8:* Has ghost at +73 Ha
    $$ to discuss

In-d: GHOST_In-20eV (In-spd is much better for GW)


Sn-d: (ghost at +60, use Sn-spd for GW)

Sb-d: ghost at +20 eV, Use Sb-spd for GW (let's call it high)

Te-d:** ghost at +77 eV  (Should try Te-spd for GW)

I : needs a GW version

Xe

Cs-sp: logders are deviation from 2.5 H no ghosts to be seen however

Ba-sp-new: seems to have a ghost around 6 eV

Hf: Needs a GW version fsp is probably unavoidable but log ders are not optimal.
    the p version is the only one that does not have an explicit f projector, did we never try?

Ta: the missing f, only at 1 H below hte femilevel is probably to much to classifie the sp as GW

W:

Re: needs GW version

Os: needs GW version

Ir: removed the GW tag, 4f to close



Pb-d: (ghost at +70, Pb-d has been replaced by Pb-d-new)
       Use Pb-spd for GW)



Bi-d:* (ghost at +70, use Bi-spd for GW)

Po-d (ghost at +58, use Po-spd for GW)

[DONE, TO BE TESTED]
Tc-sp: Tc-sp replaced by Tc-sp-new (better df, smoother)

Ba:
    Ba-sp-new adds two projectors for f. 

Pt-sp: Regenerated with modcore 3
       (Pt-p gives much better deltafactor but has ghosts at +25 eV, 
        Pt-ex-sp does not improve, new df with pt-sp-icmod3 is 4.8)
        Ask michiel about MC


TODO: Pd --> Cd (look at Pd/Ag/Cd carefully)
TO BE INVESTIGATED:
Cu-sp high
Test that there's no fr pseudo with local part taken from v(L)

GGA_X_PBE_SOL = 116 GGA_C_PBE_SOL = 133

W-sp, Re-sp (f channel could be improved)

LDA_X = 1
LDA_C_PW = 12
7: dict(x=xcf.LDA_X, c=xcf.LDA_C_PW),          # PW 001012

In-d is very sensitive, changing XC (GGa-->LDA) gives a ghost very close to 0.
The first s projectors presents oscillations I don't see in the other pseudos.
