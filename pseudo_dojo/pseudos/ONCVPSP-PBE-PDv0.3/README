H: 
    H.psp8 uses p as local part

He: 
    He.psp8 uses p as local part, just as accurate as the standard but cheaper

O:** 
    O.psp8 has lmax=d (could smooth v(d))

F:***   
    F.psp8 can be improved (too hard)

Ne:* 
    Pseudos without nlcc.
    Ne.psp8: Hard to converge (btw: no model core charge). Try: fcfact 1.0 rcfact 1.15-1.25

Na:
    Na/Na-sp-gw.in: (no model core charge)

Mg:
    Mg.psp8 has ghost at +80 eV, it's the fast low-accuracy version
    Mg-sp-gw.psp8 does not have model core charge.

Al:** oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version

Si:** oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version

P:** requires GW version (bad mcore, dloc version --> no FR)

S:* requires GW version

Cl:** (vloc(d), slow convergence)

Ti-sp:* mc look ok but ask Michiel about mc params

V-sp:* mc maybe a bit too hard

Mn:****

Co:** ask michiel about mc in particular although I don't think we can improve it

Fe: 
    the potentials uses ncon 3, the standard is 4
    Fe-sp:** model core charge too hard, try the one from Fe-sp-high.

Zn-sp:* 
    I've added the GW tag (ok but not "perfect", ask Michiel if he has specialized version)
    Ask about mc params

Ge-d*: Require GW version (Ge-spd I've recently generated looks good but it's hard)

As:** No convergence (v(d)?)
As-d:* Require GW version (maybe As-spd?)

Se-d:* Require GW version (maybe Se-spd?)

Nb:* (large v(s))

Rh:** (high vs)

Pd.psp8: Previous attempt to generate Pd without semicore lead to ghost state at +1 eV  

Ag.psp8: It seems it's difficult to get good logders without semicore

Cd.psp8 Has ghost at +73 Ha (should work on Pd/Ag/Cd)
Cd-sp:*** Ask michiel about model core 

In-d:** GHOST_In-20eV (try In-spd)

Ir-sp:* (ghost test is missing)

Cs-sp:*** Should be regenerated (qcut optimization, improve logders)

Pb-d (high s, ghost at +70)

Bi-d (high p, ghost at +70)

Po (ghost at +58)

Hg: Hg-sp is missing

Te-d:** (ghost test is missing?)

Sb-d:** (ghost at +20 eV, no GW) 

Sn-d:** (ghost at +60, no GW, try Sn-spd)

Tc-sp:* (high v_s)

Os-sp:* (no ghost test)

Pt-fsp:** with modcore 1, optimize f
Pt-sp:**** with modcore 1  ask michiel
           (Pt-p gives better deltafactor but has ghosts at +25 eV)
           Pt-ex-sp does not improve)

TODO: Pd --> Cd
TO BE INVESTIGATED:
Cu-sp high
Test that there's no fr pseudo with local part taken from v(L)
