H: is a ploc version
He: is the ploc version just as accurate as the standard but cheaper
O**: is dmax  (could smooth v(d))
F***: could be improved (too hard)
Ne*: Hard to converge (brw: no model core charge) 
     Try: fcfact 1.0 rcfact 1.15-1.25

COULD BE IMPROVED
Na (no model core charge)
Na/Na-sp-gw.in:# icmod fcfact
Na/Na-sp-gw.in-0 0.04
Mg (ghost at +80 eV) --> fast
Mg/Mg-sp-gw.in 
# icmod fcfact 0 4 1.5

Al**: oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version
Si**: oscillations in ffactors, requires GW version
P**: requires GW version (bad mcore, dloc version --> no FR)
S*: requires GW version
Cl**: (vloc(d), slow convergence)
Ti-sp*: mc look ok but ask Michiel about mc params
V-sp*: mc maybe a bit too hard

Mn****
Co** ask michiel about mc in particular albeit I don't think we can improve it

Fe: the Fe potentials uses ncon 3 the standard is 4
Fe-sp**: model core charge too hard, try the one from Fe-sp-high.
Zn-sp*: I've added the GW tag (ok but not "perfect", ask Michiel if he has specialized version)
        Ask about mc params
Ga-d*: Require GW version
    

TO BE INVESTIGATED:
Pt-sp
Sr.psp8 (model core-charge!)
Te-d (Sr-sp.psp8_Te-d.psp8)
Cu-sp high
Sr-sp (bad model? high v_s) ***  Replace it with Sr-sp-new
Tc-sp (high v_s)
Rh (high vs)
Pd.psp8 (ghosts!!!!!!)
Ag (no GW)
Cd.psp (no GW)
In.psp8 (no GW)
Cd-sp ***
In-d (no GW!)
Sn (no GW)
Sn-d (no GW)
Sb-d (no GW, ghost) *
Te-d (ghosts is missing?)
Xe
Hg (no GW)
Pb-d (high s)
Bi-d (high p)
Rn (no minimum in EOS??)
W-p (ghost at 25 eV, interesting example)
Re-sp-new (f oscillates)
Pt-fsp with modcore 1 ***
Pt-sp with modcore 1
Try: Pt-sp and Pt-ex-sp
La/La-sp.in:# icmod fcfact 1 0.25

Test that there's no fr pseudo with local part taken from v(L)
