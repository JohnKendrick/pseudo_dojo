## GGA-PBE table (oncvpsp NC pseudos)

Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all pseudos have been generated using the neutral ground-state
configuration as reference, non-linear core correction is always included except for
pseudos in which the all-electron (AE) core is too localized (mentioned in the text) or pseudos with 1s in valence.
Pseudos with the GW tag have good logarithmic derivatives up to 6 H.

Pseudo's that are not mentionned here have the same input as the SR version


## In

  * In_r.in: still generated well wiht the same input as SR but the second p projector looks critical


## W

  * W-sp_.in: second  projector looks critical


## Tl

  * Tl-d_r.in: reduced the energy of the second s projector to remove a second node


## Pb 

  * Pb-d_r.in: reduced the energy of the second s projector to remove a second node


## Bi

  * Bi-d_r.in: reduced the energy of the second s projector to remove a second node 


## Po 

  * Po-d_r.in: reduced the energy of the second s projector to remove a second node
               this does actually introduce a ghost like feature about 2H above Ef
