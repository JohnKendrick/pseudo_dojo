## GGA-PBE table (oncvpsp NC pseudos)

Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all pseudos have been generated using the neutral ground-state
configuration as reference, non-linear core correction is always included except for
pseudos in which the all-electron (AE) core is too localized (mentioned in the text) or pseudos with 1s in valence.
Pseudos with the GW tag have good logarithmic derivatives up to 6 H.

Pseudo's that are not mentionned here have the same input as the SR version


## In

  * In_r.in: still generated well wiht the same input as SR but the second p projector looks critical
